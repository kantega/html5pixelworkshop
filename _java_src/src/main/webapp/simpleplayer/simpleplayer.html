<h1>A simple video player</h1>

<p>
    Your goal in this task is to create a simple video player capable of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Starting and pausing playback by listening to button click events
    </li>
    <li>
        Showing the progress of the playing video
    </li>
    <li>
        CSS: Make the play/pause buttons show a "hand" cursor on mouse over, to indicate they are clickable
    </li>
    <li>
        Can you show the pause button only when the video is playing?
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This HTML file is found in <code>src/main/webapp/simpleplayer/simpleplayer.html</code>
    You will also need to edit Javascript in <code>simpleplayer.js</code> in the same folder and perhaps some
    CSS in simpleplayer.css (The code will contain TODO comments with some additional hints)
</p>
